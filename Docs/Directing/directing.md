# ASSETS AND INFO.

Work in progress.  
Currently (9th June) a E3 can be spawned, and controlled by F10 menu's.
It spawns with EPLRS off and RADAR off. I have no idea how that looks on LotATC screen, at this time.  
  
  The E3 can be repositioned using ingame F10 menus.
  #### LOCATIONS
  1. Defensive ()
  2. Offensive East ()
